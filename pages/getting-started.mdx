# Getting Started with Kirimase

Welcome to the initial steps with Kirimase! Kirimase is here to take you from create-next-app to building real features seconds. Here, you will find guidance on installing and setting up Kirimase to make the most of it.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

-   Node.js
-   a package manager (npm / yarn / pnpm / bun)

## Installation

Kirimase can be installed globally to be accessible from any location on your system. To install Kirimase globally, use the following command:

```bash copy
npm install -g kirimase
```

If you prefer not to install it locally, you can run:

```bash copy
npx kirimase@latest *command*
```

## Setting Up Next.js

If you don't already have a Next.js application setup, you can quickly create one using `create-next-app` using your preferred package manager.

```bash copy
npx create-next-app@latest
cd your-nextjs-project
```

## Initializing Kirimase

Navigate to the directory of your Next.js application and initialize Kirimase by running:

```bash copy
kirimase init
```
